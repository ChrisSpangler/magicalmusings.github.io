***1 Reaction***, which you can take whenever a creature within range rolls for an ability check, saving throw, attack roll or damage roll.  

Your innate ability to manipulate the arcane allows you to tip certain situations in your favor. Whenever the conditions for the spell are met, you can subtract -1 to the roll. 

***At higher levels.*** You can subtract an additional -1 to the roll for every spell slot used above first level (i.e. a 9th level spell slot imposes a -9 to a roll)
