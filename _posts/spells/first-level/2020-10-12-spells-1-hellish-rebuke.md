You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you deal an additional 1d10 damage for each slot level above 1st.
