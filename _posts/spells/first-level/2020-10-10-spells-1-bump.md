***1 Reaction***, which you can take whenever a willing creature within range rolls for an ability check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll. 

Your innate ability to manipulate the arcane allows you to tip certain situations in your favor. Whenever the conditions for the spell are met, you can add +1 to the roll. 

***At higher levels.*** You can add an additional +1 to the roll for every spell slot used above first level (i.e. a 9th level spell slot grants a +9 to a roll)
