You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isnâ€™t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** You deal an additional 1d10 damage when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level.
