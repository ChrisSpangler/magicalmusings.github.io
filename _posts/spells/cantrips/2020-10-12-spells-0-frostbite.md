You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
