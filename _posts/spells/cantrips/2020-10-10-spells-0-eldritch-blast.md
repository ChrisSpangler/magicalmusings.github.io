A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** You create an additional beam when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
