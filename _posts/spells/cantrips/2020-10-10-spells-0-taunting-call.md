You release a goading shout, comment, or other taunting action laced with subtle enchantments to a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be taunted, with the target being the spell caster.

***Taunt.*** A taunted creature must use its turn either attacking its target or moving at least 5 feet towards it's taunt target. Any attack made against creatures that are not the taunt target are made at disadvantage. At the end of each of it's turns, the taunted creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature is no longer taunted. A creature can only be taunted to one target at a time. 

***At Higher Levels.*** You gain one additional target to utilize this spell against when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level.
