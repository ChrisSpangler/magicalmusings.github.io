You call forth a fiendish spirit from the Lower Planes. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Fiendish Spirit stat block below. When you cast the spell, choose Demon, Devil, or Yugoloth. The creature physically resembles a fiend of the chosen type, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell’s level in its stat block.

\\
**Magic Resistance:** The fiend has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects

***Death Throes (Demon Only).*** When the fiend drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the fiend explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 2d10 + this spell’s level fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Devil's Sight (Devil Only).*** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the fiend’s darkvision.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fiend makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down)

***Bite (Demon only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 + the spell’s level to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d12 + 3 + the spell’s level necrotic damage.

***Claws (Yugoloth Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 + the spell’s level to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + 3 + the spell’s level slashing damage. Immediately after the attack hits or misses, the fiend can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Hurl Flame (Devil Only).*** Ranged Spell Attack: +3 + the spell’s level to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 + 3 + the spell’s level fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
