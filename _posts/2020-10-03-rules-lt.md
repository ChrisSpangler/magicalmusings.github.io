There are those that play Dungeons and Dragons for the thrill of the kill. The gruesome stabbing of a Beholder right in it's eye, the decapitation of the undead Owlbear, and the well-placed headshot on a target.  An equal yet opposite demographic of players would prefer to contribute to the campaign in the form of world-building. After all, a DM provides the framework for players to live their characters stories at the end of the day. 

Enter the advent of **Loremaster Tokens (LT).** LT serve as a means to reward players for their world-building efforts without creating an imbalance between your party historians and the self-declared 'murderhobos.'

## Ways to Earn LT

LT are typically earned outside of combat. There is no limit to the amount of LT one player can hold at any point.

LT is awarded at any point at the DM's discretion. Some examples of actions that can earn LT are below:
- Writing a post-session journal from the player's character perspective (1 LT)
- Updating / providing content for a lore entry (1 LT)
- Drawing portraits of characters, events in the story, maps, or other things that are considered pertinent to the campaign's lore (LT per drawing up to DM discretion)
- Providing new / updated mechanics for implementation during sessions (3 LT) 

## Ways to Spend LT

- Outside of combat, a player can choose to use / convert five (5) LT in order to gain one (1) Action Point (AP) or vice versa.
- Outside of combat, a player can choose to expend as many LT as they wish to roll a d20 for gold pieces for each LT expended (ex. Spending 3LT would yield 3d20 worth of gold) 
- As an action, a player can choose to expend three (3) LT in order to re-roll on an Arcana, Insight, or History skill check. They must use the result of the second roll. 
- Outside of combat, a player can choose to expend six (6) LT in order to be bestowed one (1) random uncommon item.
- Outside of combat, a player can choose to expend fifteen (15) LT in order to be bestowed one (1) random rare item.
