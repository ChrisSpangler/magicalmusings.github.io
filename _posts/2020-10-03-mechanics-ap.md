Typically in Dungeons and Dragons, a DM will award Inspiration to a player based on certain positive actions the player conducts during a session. These actions are subjective from one DM to another (for example, a player could be awarded Inspiration for feeding a three-legged dog). Only one could be stored, however it gave the player the ability to re-roll at any point.

**Action Points (AP)** are an alternative to Inspiration that aims to put more power in the player's corner. AP can be used both defensively to boost rolls, as well as offensively to weaken the effect of an opponent. Players are given incentive to play as a team, take risks, and roleplay more extensively than what would be seen with a simple Inspiration system.

## Ways to Earn AP

- Players start with five (5) AP to use.
- Players can store up to 5 + 1/2 character level (rounded down) AP at any time
- Upon leveling up, a player's AP are replenished, and their AP limit is adjusted to their character level.
- Outside of combat, Five (5) Loremaster Tokens (LT) can be converted into one (1) AP or vice versa.
- AP can be awarded at any point during a session at the DM's discretion. Some examples of actions that earn AP are below:
  - Good Roleplaying of Characters
  - Creativity
  - Character Growth / Loss
  - Heroism in Combat
  - Following a Diety / Order / Oath's tenets religiously

## Ways to Spend AP

- Players can choose to expend one (1) AP to add 1d6 to one of their own rolls below. AP can be expended before or after the roll has been completed.
  - Attack Rolls
  - Damage Rolls
  - Saving Throws
  - Skill Checks
- Players can choose to expend (1) AP in order to reverse the effect of a failed death saving throw. This reversal is considered a successful death saving throw. Natural 1s are still considered a critical failure. 
- Players can choose to expend (2) AP in order to subtract 1d6 from an enemy for the rolls below. Non-damage rolls cannot be reduced beyond a 1. 
  - Attack Rolls
  - Damage Rolls
	- Any negative damage on a creature is converted to temporary HP.
  - Saving Throws
  - Skill Checks
- Players can give other players AP. No more than two (2) AP can be transferred from player to player per turn during combat. A player cannot transfer more AP than they have, nor can a player accept more AP than their limit allows.
