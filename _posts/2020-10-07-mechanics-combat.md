## Combat Step by Step

1. **Determine Suprise.** The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.

2. **Establish Positions.** The DM decides where all the characters and Monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ Marching Order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.

3. **Roll Initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.

4. **Take Turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order.

5. **Begin the Next Round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the Initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the Initiative order) in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM--controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character.

Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and Monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

### Surprise

A band of adventurers sneaks up on a Bandit camp, springing from the trees to Attack them. A Gelatinous Cube glides down a dungeon Passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains Surprise over the other.

The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone Hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a Reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

## Your Turn

There are five main components of combat that can be taken during your turn. A helpful graphic has been included to the right for reference. 

* Movement
* Action
* Bonus Action
* Reaction
* Free Action / Interaction

You can pass on using any or all parts of your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the ***Dodge*** or ***Ready*** actions described below. 

### Movement

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different ways of moving can be combined with walking, or can constitute your entire movement phase. 

Regardless, you subtract the distance of each part of your move from your total speed until you are either done or it is used up. 

#### Breaking Up your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some or all of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take an action, then move 20 feet. 

Additionally, you can break up your movement further between multiple actions / attacks. 

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are Prone.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of Movement equal to half your speed.
For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of Movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough Movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of Movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of Movement.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder--strewn caverns, briar-- choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of Movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether Hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Flying

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of Falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.

#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a Hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a Hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity Attack.

##### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. Table: Size Categories shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat.
Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

###### Space 

A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium Hobgoblin stands in a 5-- foot--wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the Hobgoblin lets them.

A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

###### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a Passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Dexterity Saving Throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.


#### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move.

Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a Wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.
