**TLDR: A guide on what you can do with your downtime. Just like in the title. They're alphabetical so if you're looking for a specific one, just scroll to it.**

Recently my group had just finished an adventure and our DM gave us some downtime. However, finding what you can do with your downtime is a chore due to the fact that it spans across three different books with rules that can differ. So I made this guide with the goal of cataloging everything you can do with your downtime all in one place.

I will be covering mostly everything you can do with your downtime. While I won't be posting graphs and charts for each one, I'll try to go in depth enough to help you make an educated decision. Once you do make a decision, I implore you to check the rulebook from which it came from as these are just descriptions and not the actual rules. I'll list the pros and cons for each activity, but ultimately, everything comes down to whether your DM will allow it or not. For example, some of them require certain services to be available, and it is up to your DM whether or not that service is available.

## Executive Summary

Just because I listed it or it is in the book doesn't mean that they are the only options you have. Talk with your DM about what you want to do and come up with a plan and the associated cost. Players should be free to spend their money and time on what they wish. A sailor may want to build a boat and a fighter may want to spend their time doing menial escort missions. However, I would suggest two thing when creating downtime activities:

1. You are an adventurer. Sure running a business or carousing is fun, but in the end you are an adventurer, whether it is because you like it or you have to. A downtime event shouldn't overwrite the desire to adventure. If it does, then that character becomes an NPC, doing the same task over and over again. If a downtime event does a lot for a downtime even, consider making it into a session. Setting up a business can turn into a session full of unexpected events and smuggling illegal goods could create a session where you run into the local law enforcement. At it's core, you're playing D&D, full of adventure and role play, so don't turn your game into a resource management where you wait for the downtime activity to be over only to continue to the next one.
2. Make sure it is okay with both the DM and your party. Don't try and derail a whole campaign. If you have the magical mcguffin that will save the world and you decide to sell it, your party isn't going to be happy with it. On the flip side, if you create a downtime activity that generates way too much gold or benefit's you too much, your DM might try to change it. Collaborate and try to find a way to come to a conclusion. In the end, everyone should be happy with the activity.

## Lifestyle Expenses

We can't talk about downtime without talking about lifestyle expenses. While some downtime activities allow you to circumvent this cost, if you don't plan on doing anything with your downtime (which you shouldn't), you will be required to pay this cost in order to afford lodging, food, and the maintaining of armor and weapons. The gold you pay depends on the quality of life you are living. The poorer the lifestyle, the less you pay. The cost of living might be higher or lower depending on how much gold your DM gives your party.

| Lifestyle | Price per Day |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|
|Wretched   | -- |
|Squalid    | 1 sp |
|Poor       | 2 sp |
|Modest     | 1 gp |
|Comfortable| 2 gp |
|Wealthy    | 4 gp |
|Aristocratic| 10gp minimum|

Alternatively, if you have proficiency in the Survival skill, you are able to live a comfortable life in the wild but cannot do any other activity. If you are a member or a friend of a guild or group, you may be able to live there without paying the expense as well.

Depending on your DM and the lifestyle you chose, you could gain important contacts or connections with other people. Spending time living with the poor might net you allies with the local beggars and street urchins or living an aristocratic life could help you gain favor with a wealthy noble.
