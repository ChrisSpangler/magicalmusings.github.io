Kallista Xendros (or just Kallista for short) is a Discord bot utilized in order to manage currency and perform minor functions supporting Game Mastering for Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition. 

Currencies that are tracked include:
- <a href="{{baseURL}}/mechanics/action-points/">**Action Points**</a>
- <a href="{{baseURL}}/mechanics/downtime/">**Downtime**</a>
- <a href="{{baseURL}}/mechanics/loremaster-tokens/">**Loremaster Tokens**</a>
- **In-game Currency**
  - Platinum (pp), Electrum (ep), Gold (gp), Silver (sp), Copper (cp)

Her other features currently include:
- **Magic Item Rolls:** Players (or users) with enough gold to spare can spend it with Kallista in order to obtain a random magical item. When rolling, the prices for each potential item are based on the following:
  - ***Uncommon (UC).*** 250 gp
  - ***Rare (R).*** 2,500 gp
  - ***Very Rare (VR).*** 25,000 gp
  - ***Legendary (L).*** 50,000 gp

Kallista is written in Python utilzing the Discord.py wrapper, tracking player data via SQLite3. The bot is sustained using Flask on Repl.it with regular pings coming from Uptime Robot to prevent inactivity. You can see the source code for Kallista on Github.
