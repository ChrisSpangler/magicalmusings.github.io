Combat should feel real, and have consequences on both sides to determine just how bad that encounter really was. Although you can't necessarily account for all possible ways combat can go, you can generalize potential "issues" that might arise. War veterans tend to be chock full of complications after returning from battle. D&D tends to gloss over this with a group of adventurers, however, which led to many to want to implement a **lingering injury** system. 

A **lingering injury** is a debilitating effect that is sustained outside of combat. Most of these injuries can heal over time, or be treated by a doctor if you have enough money. However, missing limbs and other body parts can only be restored by the use of *Regeneration* or similar spells. Alternatively, they can also be replaced by costly prosthetics with DM approval. 

There are two ways a creature can sustain a lingering injury:
- When it takes a critical hit (or more than half it's health in damage by one hit)
- When it drops to 0 hit points, but isn't killed outright.

Once the potential for a lingering injury arises, the creature (or the player controlling the creature) will roll a Constitution save against a DC equal to the damage you took. If you fail, you must roll 1d10 on one of the tables below, depending on which damage type brought you to 0.
