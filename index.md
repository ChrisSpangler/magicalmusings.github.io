Welcome to Magical Musings!

I use this platform to post all of my D&D related ramblings from time to time, whether it be thoughts on mechanics, rulings for my players, or general homebrew content that comes to me like visions from an angry god. Mostly I work in 5th Edition rules, however I might delve into Pathfinder 2nd Edition at some point. 

Feel free to peruse these pages to your hearts content! 

**NOTE:** This site is constantly in an "development" state. Feel free to send any bugs / issues / suggestions to the <a href="https://github.com/magicalmusings/magicalmusings.github.io/issues">Issue Tracker on Github</a>, or by email to <a href="mailto:magical.musings2020@gmail.com">magical.musings2020@gmail.com</a>

### Building the Website on Local Machines 

See the [Jekyll Quick Start](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) guide for more detailed steps on how to build sites locally. 

#### Instructions 

1. Install all [prerequisites](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install the jekyll and bundler [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems)

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Build the site in the main directory and make it available on a local server. The ```--livereload``` option makes it so Jekyll automatically refreshes the page with each change you make to the source files.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

4. Navigate to [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000)

It's that simple! If you encounter any errors during this process, check that you have installed all the prerequisites in [Requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements). If you still have issues, see [Troubleshooting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems).

## Issues / Feature Requests

In the event you find any bugs / typos, or want to suggest adding information or content to the site, feel free to open up an issue on [the Issue Tracker](https://github.com/magicalmusings/magicalmusings.github.io/issues) detailing everything you want me to know. ***For my D&D Players, there may be in-game incentive on the line if you help me out this way!!***
